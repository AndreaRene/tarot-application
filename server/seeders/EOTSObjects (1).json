The skeletal remnants of the arch loom ominously over her right shoulder, while to her left, a skeletal tree reaches out like a gnarled claw, its bare branches clawing at the bruised violet sky. A chilling silence hangs heavy in the air, broken only by the occasional crunch of the Fool's footsteps on the parched earth. \n\nThe relentless sun has bleached the sky a pale blue, and the ground stretches out in an endless expanse of cracked earth, the color of sun-bleached parchment. The air is hot and dry, carrying the faint scent of dust and decay. The tattered fabric of her robe, a rough, scratchy wool, chafes against her skin.",

Bronze runes, hinting at potent knowledge, are etched into the somber bodice that clasps her form. This echoes the intricate carvings upon the bracers she wears, their cold metal barely visible beneath the billowing sleeves of her soft blue cloak. \n\nAgainst the twilight sky, a bramble halo encircles her head. The gnarled branches, alive with an unsettling energy, seem to strain towards her, as if yearning for connection. The air hangs heavy with a chill, pierced by an almost electric sensation, a raw, barely restrained power emanates from her veiled form. \n\nIn her skeletal right hand, she holds aloft a lantern. Its glass, hazy with age, distorts the image of the flickering candle flame, casting an eerie glow on her hand. The faint light from the stars scattered across the darkening sky barely penetrates the veil, leaving the potent secrets she holds securely hidden. Her long, flowing skirt, woven from the same blue cloth as her cloak, pools at her skeletal feet, its hem adorned with grasping brambles that cling momentarily to her touch.",
