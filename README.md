The Tarot Deck app is intended for entertainment purposes only. While tarot reading can offer insight and reflection, it should not be taken as expert advice or absolute truth. The readings provided by this app are generated at random and are meant to be a fun and interactive way to engage with the tradition of tarot.

The creators of Tarot Deck are not responsible for any actions taken by individuals as a result of using the app. We encourage all users to apply their own judgment and to treat the readings as a playful activity rather than a definitive guide to personal decisions or life choices.
