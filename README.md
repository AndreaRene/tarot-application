# Tarot Deck

This application is practice for me to work with databases. The intention is to create an application that can provide a tarot reading using multiple different spreads.

## Features

In the finished project, the users will have the abilities to:

- Specify whether or not to include reverse cards
- Select a spread for a reading
- Specify the amount of detail they want their reading to give
- Save readings
- Create a daily/weekly tarot journal
- View their account and reading information/history on a dashboard

Further goals for the project include the ability to:

- Select a specific deck
- Share their journal or readings publicly or with friends
- Suggest updates to readings
- Personalize dashboard theme
