            <h2>Why this app?</h2>
            <p>Our journey began from a simple realization: Despite the wealth of tarot resources online, we couldn't find a mobile app that truly catered to our needs. Existing websites offered comprehensive information, but we craved the convenience of an all-in-one, on-the-go solution.</p>

            <p>We wanted a digital tool that could house multiple decks, provide insightful spread information, and offer on-demand readings without the need to lug around a heavy bag of decks and books. This app is our answer to that needâ€”a portable tarot companion for both novices and experienced users alike, empowering you to explore the depths of tarot wherever you go.</p>
