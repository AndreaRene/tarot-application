            <p>
                Our journey began from a simple realization: Despite the wealth of tarot resources online, we couldn't
                find a mobile app that truly catered to our needs. Existing websites offered comprehensive information,
                but we craved the convenience of an all-in-one, on-the-go solution.
            </p>

            <p>
                We wanted a digital tool that could house multiple decks, provide insightful spread information, and
                offer on-demand readings without the need to lug around a heavy bag of decks and books. This app is our
                answer to that needâ€”a portable tarot companion for both novices and experienced users alike, empowering
                you to explore the depths of tarot wherever you go.
